# Pop up menu task


> A new Javascript linter file was added and all changes were successful as linters errors were fixed. The introductory, "my recent works", "about me" and the contact form page has been finished for the mobile version and desktop version for the personal portfolio. The current project involves entering the markup for display cards and the modal dynamically through Javascript. Also event listeners were included to add functionality to the respective buttons.
